# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

In this assignment, I attempted to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I will ran into some problems though, and it is currently not functioning. Although I double and triple checked my paths for connecting my js and css files, I was getting an error that they were not found. In addition, heroku is displaying an application error that I could not figure out.


### App Design Notes

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
